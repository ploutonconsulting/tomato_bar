## GoF Patterns — Selection Guide

| Problem signal in code | Pattern | Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| Complex object with many optional parameters | Builder | Readable construction, avoids telescoping constructors |
| One instance needed application-wide | Singleton | Controlled shared access |
| if/switch block dispatching on type for behaviour | Strategy | Swap algorithms at runtime; closed to modification |
| Need to add behaviour without changing existing class | Decorator | Open/closed; composable extensions |
| Complex subsystem exposed directly to callers | Facade | Simplified API; reduces coupling |
| One object change must notify many dependents | Observer | Decoupled event propagation |
| Actions that need undo/redo or queuing | Command or Memento | Reversibility; audit trail |
| Behaviour changes based on object state | State | Eliminates state-flag if/switch chains |
| Part-whole hierarchies treated uniformly | Composite | Recursive tree structures |
| Two incompatible interfaces need to work together | Adapter | Bridge without modifying either side |
| Expensive or sensitive object needs controlled access | Proxy | Lazy loading; protection; remote access |
| Request passed through a chain of handlers | Chain of Responsibility | Decoupled pipeline; each handler decides pass/handle |
| Many objects communicate in complex, tangled ways | Mediator | Central coordination; reduces coupling |
| Creating families of related objects | Abstract Factory | Consistent product families; swappable themes |
| Object creation logic belongs in subclasses | Factory Method | Deferred instantiation; extensible creation |
| Copying expensive objects | Prototype | Clone instead of reconstruct |
| Shared state across many fine-grained objects | Flyweight | Memory efficiency at scale |

## Analysis Patterns (Fowler) — Selection Guide

These apply primarily to domain modelling rather than code structure.

| Problem signal in domain | Pattern | Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| People and organisations treated as separate types | Party | Unified abstraction; shared contact/identity logic |
| Responsibility chains need tracking and auditing | Accountability | Explicit, queryable responsibility records |
| Measurements stored as raw numbers | Quantity + Measurement | Unit safety; conversion; audit trail |
| Multiple org hierarchy views hardcoded in parallel | Organisation Structure | Single model, multiple configurable views |
| Product descriptions duplicated across instances | Product + Product Type | Separation of description from instance |
| Product bundles and composites | Package | Composite product structure |
| Ledger / balance tracking without audit trail | Account + Transactions | Double-entry; immutable history; reconciliation |
| Accounting rules embedded in business logic | Posting Rules | Rules externalised; change without code deployment |
| Business rules hardcoded, not configurable | Knowledge Level | Rules separated from instances; runtime configuration |
| Entity has different IDs in different systems | Identification Scheme | Unified identity; cross-system resolution |
| Plans compared against actuals | Plan + Resource Allocation | Intent vs. execution tracking |
| Names change over time or have multiple forms | Name | Temporal name history; named type variants |

## Combined Signals — What to Look For

| Code / design smell | Likely pattern family |
|---|---|
| Large if/switch/when on type or state | Strategy, State, Factory Method |
| Constructor with 5+ parameters | Builder |
| Two classes too tightly coupled | Facade, Mediator, Observer |
| Adding features requires editing existing classes | Decorator, Strategy (OCP violation) |
| Raw numbers for physical or financial values | Quantity (Fowler) |
| Repeated instantiation of the same concrete class | Singleton, Prototype, Factory Method |
| Objects need undo or history | Command, Memento |
| Domain has people, orgs, roles | Party, Accountability (Fowler) |
| Hierarchical data traversed uniformly | Composite |
| Interface mismatch between components | Adapter |
| Event-driven updates across many dependents | Observer |
| Financial tracking without double-entry structure | Account + Transactions (Fowler) |
