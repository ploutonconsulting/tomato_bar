conventions evolve — the skill command reads it fresh on every invocation.

## Visual Hierarchy

Establish a clear reading order so users know where to look first.

- Use size, weight, and position to signal importance
- Larger, bolder items at the top are perceived as most important
- Right-align price and numeric data to draw the eye naturally
- Use images to aid scanning and add visual interest

## Signifiers and Interaction States

Every interactive element must have all applicable states styled — an unstyled
state is a design bug, not a missing feature.

| State | Description |
|---|---|
| Default | Normal resting appearance |
| Hover | Visual response on cursor over (web / desktop) |
| Active / Pressed | Visible feedback during press or tap |
| Disabled | Grayed out, non-interactive, not focusable |

- Use containers to group related items
- Use grayed-out text for inactive states
- Highlight active navigation items
- Always provide system feedback: loading spinners, success messages, error toasts

## Spacing — The 4-Point Grid

All padding, margins, gaps, and component sizing must use multiples of 4.

Common values: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64 (px / dp / pt)

- Consistent across screen densities — critical for Android dp and iOS pt
- Related elements (e.g. label + subtext) sit closer together than unrelated ones
- Let elements breathe — negative space is not wasted space

---

## Typography

- One font family only — sans-serif preferred
- Maximum six size variants to maintain hierarchy
- Large display / header text:
  - Letter spacing: -2% to -3%
  - Line height: 110% to 120%

---

## Color — Semantic Use

| Colour | Role |
|---|---|
| Blue | Trust / informational |
| Red | Danger / destructive action |
| Yellow | Warning |
| Green | Success / confirmation |

**Dark mode depth:** elevated surfaces (cards, sheets, modals) are *lighter*
than the background — opposite of light mode which uses shadows.

---

## Shadows

Shadows must be subtle. If the shadow registers before the content, it is too strong.

- High blur radius, low opacity
- Applies to card elevation, bottom sheets, modals, and dropdowns

## Components and Micro-interactions

### Icons
Match icon size to the line height of adjacent text.
Example: 24px line height → 24px icon.

### Buttons
| Type | Use |
|---|---|
| Filled / solid | Primary CTA only — one per view |
| Ghost (border, no fill) | Secondary actions |
| Text only | Tertiary / destructive confirmations |

### Micro-interactions
Every user action needs visible confirmation — silence feels broken.
Examples: copied chip slides up, toast animates in, checkbox animates on select.
